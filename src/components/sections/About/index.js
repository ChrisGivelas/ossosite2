                    In 1966, owner Marino Osso arrived in Canada at the age of nineteen from Calabria, Italy. Being
                    raised by two hardworking farmers, he knew the value of making an honest living and was inspired to
                    pursue a trade. Determined to succeed, he obtained his license in Electrical Construction
                    Maintenance from George Brown College in 1972. Marino then opened a contracting operation called
                    Osso Electric Limited, where he dedicated twelve years to perfecting his craft. In 1984, he sold
                    Osso Electric and began a new venture through the knowledge he developed as an expert businessman in
                    the lighting field. Thanks to the support that we have received from the community, Osso City
                    Lighting is now celebrating 30+ years of customer satisfaction.
